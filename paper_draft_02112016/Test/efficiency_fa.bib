	title = {Evaluating the {Efficiency} of {Frontier}-based {Exploration} {Strategies}},
	abstract = {Exploration and mapping are fundamental prerequisites for autonomous robots operating in initially unknown environ-
ments. In this paper, we evaluate simple yet efficient frontier-based exploration strategies. Furthermore, we discuss
improvements to the classic frontier-based exploration strategy by Yamauchi et al. that further shorten the resulting ex-
ploration paths and present results from a comparative evaluation with a reference exploration strategy taken from the
literature.},
