	title = {Coordinated {Multi}-{Robot} {Exploration} using a {Segmentation} of the {Environment}},
	abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of exploring
an unknown environment with a team of mobile robots. The
key issue in coordinated multi-robot exploration is how to
assign target locations to the individual robots such that the
overall mission time is minimized. In this paper, we propose a
novel approach to distribute the robots over the environment
that takes into account the structure of the environment.
To achieve this, it partitions the space into segments, for
example, corresponding to individual rooms. Instead of only
considering frontiers between unknown and explored areas as
target locations, we send the robots to the individual segments
with the task to explore the corresponding area. Our approach
has been implemented and tested in simulation as well as
in real world experiments. The experiments demonstrate that
the overall exploration time can be significantly reduced by
considering our segmentation method.},
