@article{amir_mobarhani_histogram_2011,
	title = {Histogram {Based} {Frontier} {Exploration}},
	abstract = {This paper proposes a method for mobile robot
exploration based on the idea of frontier exploration which
suggests navigating the robot toward the boundaries between free
and unknown areas in the map. A global occupancy grid map of
the environment is constantly updated, based on which a global
frontier map is calculated. Then, a histogram based approach is
adopted to cluster frontier cells and score these clusters based on
their distance from the robot as well as the number of frontier
cells they contain. In each stage of the algorithm, a sub–goal is set
for the robot to navigate. A combination of distance transform
and A* search algorithms is utilized to generate a plausible path
toward the sub-goal through the free space. This way keeping
a reliable distance from obstacles is guaranteed while searching
for the shortest path toward the sub-goal. When such a path
is generated, a B-spline interpolated and smoothed trajectory is
produced as the control reference for the mobile robot to follow.
The whole process is iterated until no unexplored area remains in
the map. The efficiency of the method is shown through simulated
and real experiments.},

	abstract = {In this paper, the exploration and map-building of unknown environment by a team of mobile robots is intensively
investigated. A new exploration technique is proposed to increase the exploration efficiency. In particular, the new
technique has two main objectives: firstly, it aims at reducing the exploration time and the traveled distance by reducing
the overlap which takes place when a certain area in the environment is explored by more than one robot. To achieve
this, a new procedure to assign the next target location for each individual robot is proposed. And secondly, it aims at
reducing computations complexity required by target selection and path planning tasks. More importantly, the proposed
technique obviates the need for environment segmentation complex procedures which is adopted in some previous
important research works. The new technique is intensively tested with different environments. The results showed the
effectiveness of the proposed technique.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of exploring
an unknown environment with a team of mobile robots. The
key issue in coordinated multi-robot exploration is how to
assign target locations to the individual robots such that the
overall mission time is minimized. In this paper, we propose a
novel approach to distribute the robots over the environment
that takes into account the structure of the environment.
To achieve this, it partitions the space into segments, for
example, corresponding to individual rooms. Instead of only
considering frontiers between unknown and explored areas as
target locations, we send the robots to the individual segments
with the task to explore the corresponding area. Our approach
has been implemented and tested in simulation as well as
in real world experiments. The experiments demonstrate that
the overall exploration time can be significantly reduced by
considering our segmentation method.},
