	abstract = {This paper proposes a method for mobile robot
exploration based on the idea of frontier exploration which
suggests navigating the robot toward the boundaries between free
and unknown areas in the map. A global occupancy grid map of
the environment is constantly updated, based on which a global
frontier map is calculated. Then, a histogram based approach is
adopted to cluster frontier cells and score these clusters based on
their distance from the robot as well as the number of frontier
cells they contain. In each stage of the algorithm, a subâ€“goal is set
for the robot to navigate. A combination of distance transform
and A* search algorithms is utilized to generate a plausible path
toward the sub-goal through the free space. This way keeping
a reliable distance from obstacles is guaranteed while searching
for the shortest path toward the sub-goal. When such a path
is generated, a B-spline interpolated and smoothed trajectory is
produced as the control reference for the mobile robot to follow.
The whole process is iterated until no unexplored area remains in
the map. The efficiency of the method is shown through simulated
and real experiments.},
